# TDAmeritrade_API
Since the Yahoo Finance API is now deprecated, this program was updated to work with the TD Ameritrade API (requires developer account with TDA). 

Basic program that uses the TDA API and parsing libraries to download historical stock data (from 1/3/2000 to present) and save it locally to your computer.  

Just provide your own API key.  


Features to be added soon: 

1. Implement command line utility that takes up to 5 arguments (2-4 tickers and a timeframe) and generate a correlation table based on their historical price data for the given timeframe.
