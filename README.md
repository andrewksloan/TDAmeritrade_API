# TDAmeritrade_API
Since the Yahoo Finance API is now deprecated, this program was updated to work with the TD Ameritrade API (requires developer account with TDA). 

It is a basic program that uses the TDA API and parsing libraries to download historical stock data from the SP500 (from 1/3/2000 to present) and save it locally to your computer.  

Just provide your own TDA API key.  


Features to be added soon: 

1. Implement command line utility that takes up to 5 arguments (2-4 tickers and a timeframe) and generate a correlation table based on their historical price data for the given timeframe.

2. Command line utility that takes x arguments.  Plots and overlays graphs of SP500 companies entered by user input for the past y days.
