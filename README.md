# TDAmeritrade_API
Since the Yahoo Finance API is now deprecated, this program was updated to work with the TD Ameritrade API (requires developer account with TDA). 

Basic program that uses the TDA API and parsing libraries to download historical stock data (from 1/3/2000 to present) and save it locally to your computer.  

Provide your own API key.  

More features to be added later.
